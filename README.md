LGT8FX8P ISP programmer using FT232R in bitbanging mode.

**ATTENTION:**  this is not a working version; try it on your own risk.


When the test program (HEX format) flashed with the bootloader or the LGTISP here's the result:

When converted to BIN and flashed with the FT232R here's the result:

The PB5 LED blinks as expected in the two cases.

Can some one, please, geuss what's going wrong in the 2nd case (using FT232R)?
